This "hello, world" was done in JavaScript.

The only dependency that JavaScript really needs to run on Visual Studio Code is Node.js.

To compile JavaScript you must install Node.js which will allow you to run JavaScript on Visual Studio Code.

To execute the code we assign the variable `message` to the string "hello, world" that we want to print and then use the `console.log` function since this is JavaScript to print the message
